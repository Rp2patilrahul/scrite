Scriptalay is an online library of screenplays accessible within the Scrite app. 

Currently the listed screenplays are all available in Scrite format, however our growing repository may also include publicly available PDF only screenplays in the future.

Click on a title on the left to view more info about it. The selected screenplay can then be opened in Scrite by clicking the Open button.
