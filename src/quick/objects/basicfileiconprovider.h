/**
 * The purpose of this image provider is to provide a basic icon for file based
 * on its type (inferenced by its file name extension).
 *
 * As such it returns a distinct icon for four types of files
 * - Audio
 * - Video
 * - Picture
 * - Document
 *
 * The original idea was to use QFileIconProvider. But that did not work for
 * some reason. So, I have settled for this until I figure out a way to get
 * QFileIconProvider to actually work.
